# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
The goal of the project was to analyze the trends for differing Kickstarter campaigns. This was accomplished through sifting through the data with regard differing variables, such as category and subcategory as well as launch dates and deadline dates. Out client Louise, wanted to find the best possible manner in which to have her play Fever be funded successfully. 

For the initial part of the assigned project we looked at the outcomes based on the launch date of each campaign and the impact it had on their funding success. This would show what point in the year she should launch her campaign The second analysis would be about the success of projects based on different ranges of the goal dollar amounts. This will show her how to best budget for her project to best achieve its funding.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the initial analysis we looked at the bearing that launch date had on the success of each campaign for theater-based productions. Specifically, it was looking at the breakdown of successful and failed campaigns for each month of the year. Based on the graph shown below it can be surmised that campaigns that are launched in the late Spring and early Summer find the most success. The highpoint for success can be found in May where the amount of successful campaigns are slightly more than double the amount failed campaigns. The amount of successful decreases September, and it stays relatively low for the remainder of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the secondary analysis we looked at the bearing that different ranges of goal amounts has on the success or failure of the campaigns for the subcategory of plays. Looking that the graph below we can see that for low amounts, less than $1000, we find the most success with 76% having a positive outcome. This percentage of success decreased until the $15000 to $19999 range where it goas 50/50. They continue to have a higher percentage of failed campaigns until the $35000 to $39999 range with 67% success rate, as is the case for the following range as well. It then dips to higher failure rates after this.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During the analysis of the project there some issues that arose that at times took time and effort to overcome. It took trail and error to create the pivot table for the 'Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date' as was shown in the example. However, this did lead to better understanding of the best way to format a pivot table to show and analyze the data in a way for optimal understanding for oneself and the client.

When it came to the second analysis the instructions and implementation of the instructions were very straightforward. The mistake that took place was when dollar ranges where being put in their respective columns one was skipped. This only became apparent when the graph did not look completely similar to the one provided. This shows how the simplest of errors can throw off a well thought out analysis.

The skills and tools that were learned for the exercises took time to understand and further mastery can be developed with more time and practice.


## Results

When it comes to the 'Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date' it becomes very clear that there are preferred times to launch a theater campaign to better ensure its success. The late Spring and early Summer are the times when one should launch their campaign. The month where most success can be found is during the month of May. It also becomes clear through observation that one would definitely not want to launch a campaign in December, when the number of campaigns with success is nearly equal to those that failed.

When it comes to the  'Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals' it is very clear that those plays with lower funding goals are the most successful. $20000 seems to be the upper level demarcation point for one to find the most success. It is interesting to not the success found in the $35000 to $39999 and $40000 to $44999 ranges. It is most likely that this change in the trend is a result of the low sample size for these ranges. They had only six and three total campaigns respectively. This can be contrasted to the much higher amounts of projects with a peak of 534 in the $1000 to $4999 range. This shows how data is not always clear, in this case due to the use of percentages.

 There are some possible limitations of the data set that is provided. It is from a sole crowd funding service, Kickstarter, and there may be other avenues of funding available to Louise that could be more successful for her type of project. Also, while the year range for that data provided is fairly long, 2009-2017, the inclusion of more recent years would be advantageous as trends may have changed. It is possible that it would be helpful to be able to break down the subcategory of play even further, perhaps by genre, if that information was provided. This would give a detailed and targeted plan for Louise to follow.
 
There are probably many different tables and/or graphs that could be generated to be able to provide a better and deeper analysis to Louise. One such table would be looking at the average donation amount versus both the goal amount and then the pledged amount. It could show whether one should focus on getting the greatest amount of smaller donations or focusing on those who provide much larger ones. This could also be accomplished by looking at the average donation versus success rate within the purview of the range analysis done in the secondary analysis. Much information can be gleaned by looking at the data in a multitude of ways.
